# Intro to Penguins
Using Penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*

# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("kableExtra")
library(kableExtra)
```

# Inspect the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
<!-- Working with figures
We can change lots of aspects of the figure right in our markdown document:
change size
change resolution
change "device" (i.e. is it a .png. .pdf, etc.)
save it in a specific folder -->

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species,
             y = flipper_length_mm,
             fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Species of Penguin",
       y = "Penguin flipper length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```

<!-- Save your figure in rmarkdown
You CAN still use ggsave, but there are also more automated ways to export your figures in rmarkdown

Set the file path for your figure using:
  fig.path (you can put this in a global option to send all your figures there)
  name your code chunk (this will be the name of the figure)

Place between curly braces -- label is the name of your output (plot, table, code chunk, etc.)
{r label}

Separated options with commas
{r label, option1=value} -->

# Making a table
```{r}
penguins%>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(billmean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  kbl() %>% #make it a kable table
  kable_classic()%>%
  row_spec(2, bold = T, color = "white", background = "red") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
