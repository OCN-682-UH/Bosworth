## Instructions: Instructions

# Take any of the data sheets you have already worked with in class and create 
# at least one table and one figure in an Rmarkdown file.
# Create the most beautiful RMarkdown output you can in either an html, github doc, or pdf format. 
# YOU MUST KNIT THE FILE
# Make sure you have headings with clear explanations of what you are doing.
# Practice using markdown formatting with bold, italics, and lists (use each of these at least once).
# Make sure your outputs and scripts are saved in the appropriate folders. 
# Keep proper coding etiquette (figures need to be pub quality as 
# usual and you need to comment your code).

# 2 points for figure (following best practices), 
# 2 points for table, 
# 1 point for knitting appropriately, 
# 1 point for bold, list, and italics use,
